# **Dependency Injection**

It is a software design pattern in which an object receives another objects that it depends on. These objects are called dependencies. Receiving object is called `client` and the passed object is called `service`. The code that passes or inject the service to the client is call injector.

> Passing a dependency(service) into an object(client) using an injector.
